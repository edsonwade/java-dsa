In your "Online Task Management System" project, you can use a combination of Liquibase or Flyway for database migration and Docker for containerization. Each of these tools serves a different purpose:

1. **Liquibase or Flyway for Database Migration:**
   - Both Liquibase and Flyway are popular database migration tools that allow you to manage and version your database schema and data changes. You can choose either of them based on your preferences and project requirements.
   - Use these tools to define and version your database schema, create tables for users and tasks, and apply any schema updates as your project evolves.
   - Ensure that your database schema is synchronized with your project's data model, and migrations are automated and tracked.

2. **Docker for Containerization:**
   - Docker is a valuable tool for containerizing your application, which ensures consistent deployment environments and simplifies the deployment process.
   - You can create a Docker image for your Spring Boot application, including all its dependencies. This image can be deployed on various platforms, such as local development environments, staging, or production servers.
   - Docker Compose can be used to define multi-container applications, such as your Spring Boot application and a database container (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL). This makes it easy to manage your application's database within a container.

Here's a brief overview of how you can integrate these tools into your project:

- **Database Migration with Liquibase or Flyway:**
  - Create migration scripts for creating database tables for users and tasks.
  - Define scripts for populating initial data (e.g., user roles, admin user).
  - Set up Liquibase or Flyway configurations in your Spring Boot application to automatically apply migrations on startup.

- **Docker Integration:**
  - Create a Dockerfile for your Spring Boot application, specifying its dependencies and settings.
  - Use Docker Compose to define a multi-container setup, including your Spring Boot application and a database container.
  - Build and run your application and database containers locally for development and testing.

By combining Liquibase or Flyway for database migration and Docker for containerization, you can ensure that your application's database schema is versioned and managed efficiently. Additionally, Docker provides consistency and portability in deploying your application across different environments.
